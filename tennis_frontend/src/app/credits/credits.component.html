        Section 2 -- Scope. <br>
        <br>
          a. License grant. <br>
          <br>
              1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, <br>
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, <br>
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to <br>
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: <br>
                  <br>
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or <br>
                      in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and <br>
                      <br>
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for <br>
                      NonCommercial purposes only. <br>
                      <br>
              2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where <br>
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public <br>
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with <br>
                  its terms and conditions.<br>
                  <br>
              3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section <br>
                  6(a).<br>
                  <br>
              4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The <br>
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in <br>
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, <br>
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The <br>
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or <br>
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications <br>
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including <br>
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective <br>
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, <br>
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) <br>
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material. <br>
                  <br>
              5. Downstream recipients. <br>
              <br>
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every <br>
                      recipient of the Licensed Material automatically <br>
                      receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the <br>
                      Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this <br>
                      Public License. <br>
                      <br>
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material. <br>
                      Every recipient of Adapted Material from You <br>
                      automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to <br>
                      exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material <br>
                      under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply. <br>
                      <br>
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose <br>
                      any additional or different terms or conditions on, or <br>
                      apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the <br>
                      Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the <br>
                      Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed <br>
                      Material. <br>
                      <br>
              6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or <br>
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You <br>
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected <br>
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, <br>
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as <br>
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). <br>
                  <br>
          b. Other rights. <br>
          <br>
              1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not <br>
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, <br>
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to <br>
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to <br>
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited <br>
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed <br>
                  Rights, but not otherwise.<br>
                  <br>
              2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this <br>
                  Public License. <br>
                  <br>
              3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to <br>
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed <br>
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society <br>
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory <br>
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly <br>
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when <br>
                  the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial <br>
                  purposes. <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
        Section 3 -- License Conditions. <br>
        <br>
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the <br>
        following conditions. <br>

                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if <br>
                            designated); <br>
                            <br>
                        ii. a copyright notice; <br>

              2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any <br>
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in <br>

                  information.<br>
              3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the <br>

                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and <br>
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material. <br>
                  <br>
              3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms <br>
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological <br>
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the <br>
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. <br>

                  <br> 
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. <br>
        <br>
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that <br>
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: <br>
        <br>
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right <br>
            to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial <br>
            portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes <br>
            only; <br>
            <br>
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database <br>
            contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database <br>
            Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database <br>
            Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, <br>
            including for purposes of Section 3(b); and <br>
            <br>
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share <br>
            all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. <br>
            <br>
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not <br>
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed <br>
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. <br>
        <br>
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE <br>
            EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS <br>
            AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF <br>
            ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, <br>
            IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, <br>
            WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR <br>
            PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, <br>
            ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT <br>
            KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT <br>
            ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. <br>
            <br>
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE <br>
            TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, <br>
            NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, <br> 
            INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, <br>
            COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR <br>
            USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN <br>
            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR <br>
            DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR <br>
            IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. <br>
            <br>
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided <br>
            above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent <br>
            possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and <br>
            waiver of all liability. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination. <br>
        <br>
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and <br>
            Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with <br>
            this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License <br>
            terminate automatically. <br>
            <br>
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under <br>
            Section 6(a), it reinstates: <br>
            <br>
              1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided <br>
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the <br>
                  violation; or <br>
                  <br>
              2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. <br>
              <br>
            For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any <br>
            right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations <br>
            of this Public License. <br>
            <br>
          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the <br>
            Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop <br>
            distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so <br>
            will not terminate this Public License. <br>
            <br>
          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public <br>
            License. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. <br>
        <br>
          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different <br>
            terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. <br>
            <br>
          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the <br>
            Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and <br>
            independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. <br>
            <br>
            <br> 
        Section 8 -- Interpretation. <br>
        <br>
          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and <br>
            shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose <br>
            conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully <br>
            be made without permission under this Public License. <br>
            <br>
          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is <br>
            deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the <br>
            minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision <br>
            cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License <br>
            without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and <br>
            conditions. <br>
            <br>
          c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no <br>
            failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the <br>
            Licensor. <br>
            <br>
          d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted <br>
            as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities <br>
            that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal <br>
            processes of any jurisdiction or authority. <br>

        "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all <br>
        other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common <br>
        control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition, <br>

        exercising permissions granted by this License. <br>
        <br>
        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, <br>
        including but not limited to software source code, documentation <br>
        source, and configuration files. <br>
        <br>
        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical <br>
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but <br>
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, <br>

        <br>
        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or <br>
        Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a <br>

        <br>
        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object <br>
        form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the <br>
        editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications <br>
        represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes <br>
        of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain <br>
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, <br>
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof. <br>
        <br>
        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including <br>
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions <br>
        to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally <br>
        submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner <br>
        or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of <br>
        the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" <br>

        excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise <br>
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution." <br>
        <br>
        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity <br>

        <br>
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, <br>
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the <br>
        Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. <br>
        <br>
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of <br>
        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, <br>
        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable <br>
        (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, <br>
        use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, <br>
        where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable <br>
        by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their <br>
        Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) <br>
        with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You <br>
        institute patent litigation against any entity (including a <br>
        cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work <br>
        or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct <br>
        or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses <br>
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate <br>
        as of the date such litigation is filed. <br>
        <br>
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the <br>
        Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without <br>
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You <br>
        meet the following conditions: <br>
        <br>
        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or <br>
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and <br>
        <br>
        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices <br>
        stating that You changed the files; and <br>
        <br>
        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works <br>
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and <br>
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, <br>
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of <br>
        the Derivative Works; and <br>
        <br>
        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its <br>
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must <br>
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained <br>
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not <br>
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one <br>
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed <br>
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or <br>
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, <br>
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and <br>
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents <br>
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and <br>
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution <br>
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside <br>
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided <br>
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed <br>
        as modifying the License. <br>
        <br>
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and <br>
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions <br>
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or <br>
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, <br>
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with <br>
        the conditions stated in this License. <br>
        <br>
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, <br>
        any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work <br>
        by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of <br>
        this License, without any additional terms or conditions. <br>
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify <br>
        the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed <br>
        with Licensor regarding such Contributions. <br>
        <br>
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade <br>
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, <br>
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the <br>
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. <br>
        <br>
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or <br>
        agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each <br>
        Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, <br>
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or <br>
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions <br>
        of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A <br>
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the <br>
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any <br>
        risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. <br>
        <br>
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, <br>
        whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, <br>
        unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly <br>
        negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be <br>
        liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, <br>
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a <br>
        result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the <br>
        Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, <br>
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all <br>
        other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor <br>
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages. <br>
        <br>
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing <br>
        the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, <br>
        and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, <br>
        or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this <br>
        License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only <br>
        on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf <br>
        of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, <br>
        defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability <br>
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason <br>
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability. <br>

          <br>
        2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby <br>

          USE OF PYTHON 3.11.7 WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. <br>
